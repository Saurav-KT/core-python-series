'''Object oriented programming is a way of enclosing  the data member and member functions into a user defined
entity called a class'''

'''Class holds perticular data items that relates to each other and communicate in a specific way. We access the properties 
and the member functions using objects'''

"""Memory is never allocated when we create a class,but memory gets allocated when we create its instance i.e object"""

'About using Self in python'

# Self argument represents the object itself.
# Self will refer to the specific instance of this object that's being operated on.
# It is a part of the Python syntax to access data member of objects.
# Self is always pointing to current object.
# Self is the first argument to be passed in constructor and instance method. If you don't provide it, will cause an error.


# use __new__ when you need to control the creation of new instance
# use _init__ when you need to control intialization of the new instance.

# A method is a function that takes a class instance as its first parameter. Methods are members of classes.
